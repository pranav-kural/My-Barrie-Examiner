# Author

My name is Pranav Kural, and I'm a Computer Programming student. I'm learning and working with technologies likes HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla, Bootstrap, SASS, SCSS and LESS), JavaScript (Node.js, Angular.js), jQuery, and Java and MySQL.

I love programming. For most part I love both front-end and back-end programming. While front-end programming allows me to use my innovation and creativity to make something that looks really GREAT, the back-end programming impress me with it's capabilities, making me realize how powerful it can be.

Most chances are that you would see me with a cup of coffee and my laptop in front of me, with my eyes into my notebook writing or designing a plan to work on something. Ideas of making some awesome web designs or plug-ins keep coming to my mind, and I keep jotting them down and work on them latter.

I believe in being a life-long learner, specially in Tech industry. I also believe in contributing to the Programming community as much as possible. I will thrive to contribute as much as I can through all my projects, which usually tend to be towards making things easier for the developers all around the world.

Thank You.

Pranav Kural :)
